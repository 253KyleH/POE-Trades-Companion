Path of Exile Trades Companion enhances your trading experience by:    
- Making sure you do not miss any sale by keeping your trading whisper in a convenient interface.    
- Allowing you to quickly communicate with your buyer using our interface and custom hotkeys.    
  
There are many more features, but each of them will be explained in their own section.  
  
// Maybe a Support section here? Small and short, so user does not have to scroll too much through it  
  
## INTERFACE  
  
There are currently 3 skins available:  
- White: A sleek, simplistic, white and blue combination.  
- Dark Blue: The "night" alternative to the White skin.  
- Path of Exile: Based on Path of Exile, it blends pretty nice with the game.  
  
// Include here a screenshot of the interface with pinpoints explaining what each part of the interface corresponds to  
// For example, whisper tab means the user received a new whisper since they last checked the "Other:" slot  
// Green tab means the buyer has joined the same area as the user  
  
## SETTINGS  
  
This tool offers lots of customization.  
You can access the Settings menu by right clicking the tray icon and choosing "Settings"  
  
### General Settings tab  
  
// Include here a screenshot explaining which setting does what  
// Introduce the user to the settings interface  
  
### Customization > Appearance tab  
  
// Explain the user that he can customize the skin here  
// Maybe also introduce him to skinning? Link "Create your own skin" wiki page.  
  
### Customization > Custom Buttons tab  
  
// Say that he can change his "big button" settings here.  
// Also explain which setting does what, so it's less confusing.  
// Explain he can link them to an hotkey if he wants to  
// Do not forget to mention the "Save the trade infos locally?" checkbox  
// Show he can set up to three messages  
// Mention the trade variables, and how to use them  
  
### Customization > Smaller Buttons tab  
  
// Not much to say here. Except that, if he wants to, he can re-arrange the buttons or disable them completely.  
// Disabling all buttons will effectively hide its space  
  
### Hotkeys > Basic tab  
  
// Explain these hotkeys are only used to send a single chat message  
// Mention that trades variables can be used here  
  
### Hotkeys > Advanced tab  
  
// Explain how these work. Say they CAN (winkwink) be used to send multiple messages, or kick yourself from a party.  
// Mention trades variables, again  
  
### Hotkeys > Special tab  
  
// Say how these interact with the tool interface  
  
## STATS  
  
// Mention the checkbox that we talked about earlier in the Settings  
// Show how kool and konvenient this interface is. Show how easy you can use the filters.
