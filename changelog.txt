Bugfix: The game's window will now only flash when a whisper is received while it is not active.
//

--v1.3--
What's new:
Added a new tab in the Settings: Hotkeys.
	The Hotkeys tab allows you to set up to 6 custom hotkeys.
Added a new button on the main GUI : "Item Sold"
	This button allows you to send a message to the person, saying the concerned item was sold.
	Pressing on this button will also close the concerned tab.
	You can, as always, customize the message being sent by going into in the Settings > Messages tab
The game's taskbar button will now blink when a whisper is received while being tabbed out.
The script will now try to run in admin mode if available.
	If it fails to do so multiple times, it will allow you to run it wihout admin privilieges
	(When running without admin privilieges, the Trades GUI buttons won't be working as the script is unable to send inputs to the game)
A special additional message can be sent to your buyer upon clicking the "Thanks" or the new "Sold" button.
	Feel free to enable it by going into the [Settings] tray menu.

What's changed:
Renamed the GUI buttons to make them shorter and prettier.
The script doesn't block multiple instancies of itself anymore, but tries to close and replace the old one instead.

What's fixed:
GUI disappearing when minimizing the game's window.
"Clipboard on Tab Switch" not working when closing a tab.
GUI buttons being out of place at exactly 19,28,29,37,38,39(and so on) tabs.
