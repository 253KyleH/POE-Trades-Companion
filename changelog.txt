What's new:
	Advanced Hotkeys. Up to 16 hotkeys. Can send multiple messages. Read more on the WIKI.
	Advanced and Basic hotkeys can now use the Trade Variables (%buyerName%, %itemName%, %itemPrice%)

What's fixed:

--v1.4--
What's new:
	You can now set the transparency of the Trades GUI by going into the [Settings] tray menu.
		The lowest you can go is 30%, to make sure the window is still able to be seen.
	"Dock Mode" being removed, you can now cycle the Trades GUI between the game's window by using the new [Cycle Overlay] in the tray option (Right click on the tray icon > Cycle Overlay)
	You can switch the Trades GUI between [Windowed] and [Overlay] by right clicking the tray icon and clicking on the according mode.
	If the logs file is deleted or characters/lines are being edited out, the script will restart the Logs Monitoring function to make sure it doesn't stall
		(^ This kind of behaviour should not happend, I consider it as an useless measure of security but I like it "just incase")
		
What's changed:
	You do not need to reload the script after changing a setting anymore, everything is instantly applied.
	"Dock Mode" and "Logs Mode" have been removed from the [Settings] menu, as it is all automatized now.
	The Trades GUI buttons now use a much faster method of sending keyboard input.
	
What's fixed:
	Tray icons from previously replaced instances of the script will now correctly disappear if they are not hidden in the sub tray notitication.
	The script will no longer skip whispers when receving two messages at the very same time.
	The Trades GUI will no longer flicker while having the "Show in game only" setting activated.
	Enabling an hotkey without binding it to a key prior will not crash the script anymore.
	You should no longer randomly receive a tray notification of a prior whisper.
	
Troubleshooting:
	About Logs Mode and Dock Mode being removed due to automatisation:
		Logs Mode:
			If the script detect multiple instance of the game, it will check the location of the logs file.
			If the logs file are located in different folders, it will show a new GUI to ask which one should be used.
			This only happens once at the very start of the Logs Monitoring function. So if you run a separate instance that doesn't use the same logs file while the script is already loaded, and want to monitor that log instead, you will need to reload the script.
		Dock Mode:
			You can still define the window the Trades GUI will dock on by using the new [Cycle Overlay] tray option (Right click on the tray icon > Cycle Overlay)
	About the new Windowed and the Overlay mode:
		Windowed:
			In Windowed mode, you can drag around the Trades GUI. If you want to move it while it's inactive (= click-through), simply open the [Settings].
			Having the Settings window open allows you to drag the Trades GUI even if it's inactive. Closing the Settings will effectively re-apply the click-through ability.
		Overlay:
			In Overlay mode, the Trades GUI will appear borderless and will dock on the top right of your game's window.
			If you are running multiple instance and the Trades GUI is docked on the wrong window, use the new [Cycle Overlay] accessible by right-clicking the tray icon.

--v1.3--
What's new:
Added a new tab in the Settings: Hotkeys.
	The Hotkeys tab allows you to set up to 6 custom hotkeys.
Added a new button on the main GUI : "Item Sold"
	This button allows you to send a message to the person, saying the concerned item was sold.
	Pressing on this button will also close the concerned tab.
	You can, as always, customize the message being sent by going into in the Settings > Messages tab
The game's taskbar button will now blink when a whisper is received while being tabbed out.
The script will now try to run in admin mode if available.
	If it fails to do so multiple times, it will allow you to run it wihout admin privilieges
	(When running without admin privilieges, the Trades GUI buttons won't be working as the script is unable to send inputs to the game)
A special additional message can be sent to your buyer upon clicking the "Thanks" or the new "Sold" button.
	Feel free to enable it by going into the [Settings] tray menu.
