# Currently in the works and only available in the Discord ALPHA

- Allow more customisation to the Buying Interface, notably buttons
- Price Verify feature improvements / Use official website instead of poe.trade
- (Consider) Make the StackClick hotkey also work with the Buying Interface.
But first, we have to find a way to focus a specific "slot" in Stack mode.
- (Consider) Find a way to combine both Selling and Buying Interfaces into one, maybe with a switch button?

# May be the focus on the next major update after 1.15
- Retrieve the user's stash tabs types by using the API.
This will allow exact location based on regular/large tab and allow to know which exact maps the user owns in their map stash tab.
- Rework entirely the LeagueSheet menu
- Chat scanner

# May happen someday. Not a priority at the moment

- Different sound effects when receiving a trading whisper based on a price treshold
- Support for bulk buying whispers (poe app bulk / poemap live)
- Be able to restore recently closed tabs
- Auto updated league sheets? By following the current market values

# Bugs to fix
- AutoHotKey ChooseString in DropDownList chooses the first match containing the string instead of exact match
- Find a way to improve the "Use BETA?" checkbox so that it is not always checked no matter what when using the BETA versions.
Maybe comparing pre-update version and post-update version, then tick/untick the box accordingly.
